# LAST Matlab class to control the tinycontrol IP power socket v2 (LANLIS-010)

6 outlets, interacted with via authenticated http queries on port 80. The status of the outlets is
 commanded by sending appropriate parameters to a script `outs.cgi` of the device webby, much of the configuration
can be read retrieving one among 7 xml datafiles, but there seems to be no documented way to change programmatically
the configuration if not through the webby.

Maybe interaction is possible via form PUTS, I'm not familiar with that too, and webpages are probably generated by javascript and are not html forms.

The pages of the webby in any event are:

- http://192.168.1.100/index.htm
- http://192.168.1.100/in_config.htm
- http://192.168.1.100/watchdoog.htm *(yes, two oo)*
- http://192.168.1.100/scheduler.htm
- http://192.168.1.100/config.htm

where 192.168.1.100 is the default IP of the device.

It should also be possible to access 20 parameters by SNMP but I'm not familiar with that.

The thing has a recessed Reset button. I rather thing that this sends a Reset event to the sockets
 (power cycles them if so defined in the configuration, rather than resetting some configuration).

I wonder if there is a way to factory reset the device, for instance to restore the default IP
 and username and password in case they have been messed up with.
